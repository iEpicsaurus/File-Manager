# File-Manager
 C++ implementation of a file manager system to help manage files on the Raspberry Pi Desktop system.

This will encapsulate both information pulled from the file system for the file(s) in question, as well as operations that can be performed on the files, with each instance of the class handling a single file. This will be accomplished using a collection of system calls and file I/O operations.

Operations Implemented: cat, cp, diff, ls, mv, rm, and stat.
